# bettercslice
Slice implementing RandomAccessRange compatible with betterC.

**WARNING:** slices are usable in betterC, this was created as an
attempt to fix some compilation errors in a project of mine when
built as betterC, and it turns out slices were not the problem.
It was good learning the Range interfaces, but we all should just
use D builtin slices.
